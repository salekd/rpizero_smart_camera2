# Smart security camera with Raspberry Pi Zero and TensorFlow Serving

This repository shows how to turn Raspberry Pi Zero into a smart security camera with the help of TensorFlow Serving. The solution is based on the following two key components:
* use of available **Motion** software to detect movement,
* use of a server running **TensorFlow Serving** with **Inception-v3** or **SDD MobileNet v1** model.

The installation procedure is documented here https://github.com/salekd/rpizero_smart_camera2/wiki
